# geoduck_exploration
geoduck age data from 2012 and 2014, exploration of age frequency distribution and catch curve analysis

See "Schnute 2007 analysis" for work done on alternative catch curve exploration.
See H drive "./R/geoduck" folder for previous work on catch curves for the entire data set and each area individually

This project focuses on concerns brought up in late 2016/ early 2017 when prepping data for publication/ use

It address:
1) weighting the area by population size, see "GeoduckAgeStudyWeighting.xls" for details on weighting values.
2) testing to see if areas are sampled from the same distrbituion - K-S tests
