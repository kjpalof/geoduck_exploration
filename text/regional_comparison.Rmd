## Regional groupings
Geoduck age collections were aggregated into regional groupings based on geography, environment, and present of predators (specifically the sea otter).  Group 1 includes the Nakat Inlet, Vallenar Bay, and Vegas/Hotspur Islands, which are all absent of sea otters.  Group 2 includes Cone Island North, East San Fernando, Tlevak Strait, Warren/Kosciusko Islands, and Sitka (Biorka and Taigud).  For purposes of this document Group 1 will be referred to as the "absent" group and Group 2 will be "present".  (we can change this later if needed - this is just a draft)

## Age Frequency
Histogram by group - with raw counts and counts weighted by population size

Histograms - unweighted

Histrograms - weigthed by populations size

## Age Composition Similar?
