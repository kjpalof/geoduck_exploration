## Regional groupings
Geoduck age collections were aggregated into regional groupings based on geography, environment, and present of predators (specifically the sea otter).  Group 1 includes the Nakat Inlet, Vallenar Bay, and Vegas/Hotspur Islands, which are all absent of sea otters.  Group 2 includes Cone Island North, East San Fernando, Tlevak Strait, Warren/Kosciusko Islands, and Sitka (Biorka and Taigud).  For purposes of this document Group 1 will be referred to as the "absent" group and Group 2 will be "present".  (we can change this later if needed - this is just a draft)

```{r}
dat <- read.csv("../data/12_14_geoduck_all.csv")
weight_pop <- read.csv("../data/GeoduckAgeStudyWeighting.csv")

weight_pop %>% mutate(ADFG_Fishery.Area = area, wt_each = popsize_wshow/(sum(popsize_wshow))) %>% 
  select (-area) %>% select(-AgeStudyWeighting)-> weight_pop

# full data set with weigtings
dat %>% left_join(weight_pop) -> dat2 # raw data
# summarized by area, age with weigthing
dat2 %>% group_by(ADFG_Fishery.Area, Age_2012) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())  -> dat2_by.area
dat2_by.area %>% left_join(weight_pop) %>% mutate(n_wt = n*wt_each) -> dat_wt_by.area # counts by age/area with weighting

## weighting counts 
dat %>% group_by(ADFG_Fishery.Area) %>% summarise(N_samp = n()) ->total.n.area  # number sampled in each area
dat_wt_by.area %>% left_join(total.n.area) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n/N_samp, n_corrected = prop*popsize_wshow) -> dat_wt_by.area2
################ data sets by sea otter ---------------
dat2 %>% filter(otter.status == "present") -> present_raw
dat2 %>% filter(otter.status == "absent") -> absent_raw
dat_wt_by.area2 %>% filter(otter.status == "present") -> present_wt
dat_wt_by.area2 %>% filter(otter.status == "absent") -> absent_wt
```  

## Age Frequency
Histogram by group - with raw counts and counts weighted by population size
![](../figures/histogram_count_both.png)

Kernal density of weighted expanded counts by groups

![](../figures/hist_density_corrected.png)

###Mean age by group 
```{r}
dat_wt_by.area2 %>% group_by(otter.status) %>% summarise(mean = weighted.mean(Age_2012, n_wt)) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Weighted Mean")

dat_wt_by.area2 %>% group_by(otter.status) %>% summarise(mean = weighted.mean(Age_2012, n)) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Mean of Raw Counts")
```

The weighted mean is used for comparisons between the groups since it takes into account the proportion of inviduals we sampled for ages compared to the population size.  
```{r}
wtd.t.test(x = present_wt$Age_2012, y = absent_wt$Age_2012, weight= present_wt$n_wt, 
           weighty = absent_wt$n_wt) # not significantly different
```

## Age Composition Similar?
More exploration is neeeded for this analysis but a simple ks test suggests they are not from the same distribution. Code ee is present and ff is absent.

```{r}
ee <- data.frame(x = rep(present_wt$Age_2012, present_wt$n_corrected), z = rep(present_wt$otter.status, present_wt$n_corrected))

ff <- data.frame(x = rep(absent_wt$Age_2012, absent_wt$n_corrected), z = rep(absent_wt$otter.status, absent_wt$n_corrected))

ks.test(ee$x, ff$x) # reject null that two are equal

ee %>% bind_rows(ff) -> all_n_corrected # expanded counts combined into one data set. x is ages and z is otter.status
```

## Growth
### VBL Length - Age
![](../figures/present_VBL1.png)

```{r}
present_raw %>% filter(!is.na (Valve.Length.mm)) -> present_rawL # needed to remove rows without length measurements
#fit model setting t0=0 
vbTypical.t0 <- Valve.Length.mm~(Linf*(1-exp(-K*(Age_2012)))) # the equation to fit
fit2 <- nls(vbTypical.t0, data=present_rawL, start= list(Linf=142, K=0.58))
summary(fit2)

```


### Weight - Length relationship
Using allometric growth model (Quinn and Deriso 1999)

#### Valve weight - length 
Group 2 - sea otter present
Coefficients estimated from this relationship were A = 0.00015 and B = 2.71.


![](../figures/present_valveweight_length.png)

#### Whole clam weight - length 
Group 2 - sea otter present
Coefficients estimated from this relationship were A = 0.00411 and B = 2.53.

### Weight - Age relationship

#### Valve Weight - Age relationship 
Group 2 - sea otter present

![](../figures/present_valveWlength.png)


```{r}
present_rawL %>% filter(!is.na (WholeClamWeight_g)) -> present_rawWL_whole
# input file for valve weight - removes blanks in these for analysis 
present_rawL %>% filter(!is.na (Valve.Weight.g)) -> present_rawWL_valve

#fit with t0=0, and B from W-L relationship B=2.71
vbTypical_WVB <- Valve.Weight.g~(Winf*(1-exp(-K*(Age_2012)))^2.71)
fit_WvalB <- nls(vbTypical_WVB, data=present_rawWL_valve, start= list(Winf=150, K=0.05))
summary(fit_WvalB) ## need to save this for .RMD
