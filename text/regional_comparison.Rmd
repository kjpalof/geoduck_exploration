## Regional groupings
Geoduck age collections were aggregated into regional groupings based on geography, environment, and present of predators (specifically the sea otter).  Group 1 includes the Nakat Inlet, Vallenar Bay, and Vegas/Hotspur Islands, which are all absent of sea otters (total sample size = 611).  Group 2 includes Cone Island North, East San Fernando, Tlevak Strait, Warren/Kosciusko Islands, and Sitka (Biorka and Taigud), which all have sea otters present (total sample size = 1048).  For purposes of this document Group 1 will be referred to as the "absent" group and Group 2 will be "present".  (we can change this later if needed - this is just a draft)

```{r}
dat <- read.csv("../data/12_14_geoduck_all.csv")
weight_pop <- read.csv("../data/GeoduckAgeStudyWeighting.csv")

weight_pop %>% mutate(ADFG_Fishery.Area = area, wt_each = popsize_wshow/(sum(popsize_wshow))) %>% 
  select (-area) %>% select(-AgeStudyWeighting)-> weight_pop

# full data set with weigtings
dat %>% left_join(weight_pop) -> dat2 # raw data
# summarized by area, age with weigthing
dat2 %>% group_by(ADFG_Fishery.Area, Age_2012) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())  -> dat2_by.area
dat2_by.area %>% left_join(weight_pop) %>% mutate(n_wt = n*wt_each) -> dat_wt_by.area # counts by age/area with weighting

## weighting counts 
dat %>% group_by(ADFG_Fishery.Area) %>% summarise(N_samp = n()) ->total.n.area  # number sampled in each area
dat_wt_by.area %>% left_join(total.n.area) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n/N_samp, n_corrected = prop*popsize_wshow) -> dat_wt_by.area2
################ data sets by sea otter ---------------
dat2 %>% filter(otter.status == "present") -> present_raw
dat2 %>% filter(otter.status == "absent") -> absent_raw
dat_wt_by.area2 %>% filter(otter.status == "present") -> present_wt
dat_wt_by.area2 %>% filter(otter.status == "absent") -> absent_wt
```  

## Age Frequency
Histogram by group - with raw counts and counts weighted by population size

###Mean age by group 
```{r}
dat_wt_by.area2 %>% group_by(otter.status) %>% summarise(mean = weighted.mean(Age_2012, n_wt)) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Weighted Mean")

dat_wt_by.area2 %>% group_by(otter.status) %>% summarise(mean = weighted.mean(Age_2012, n)) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Mean of Raw Counts")
```

The weighted mean is used for comparisons between the groups since it takes into account the proportion of inviduals we sampled for ages compared to the population size.  
```{r}
wtd.t.test(x = present_wt$Age_2012, y = absent_wt$Age_2012, weight= present_wt$n_wt, 
           weighty = absent_wt$n_wt) # not significantly different
```

## Age Composition Similar?
More exploration is neeeded for this analysis but a simple ks test suggests they are not from the same distribution. I'm currently researching other tests/ analyses to look at this, and i also think I should bin the ages and redo this test just for sensitivity.  (Code ee is present and ff is absent.)

```{r}
ee <- data.frame(x = rep(present_wt$Age_2012, present_wt$n_corrected), z = rep(present_wt$otter.status, present_wt$n_corrected))

ff <- data.frame(x = rep(absent_wt$Age_2012, absent_wt$n_corrected), z = rep(absent_wt$otter.status, absent_wt$n_corrected))

ks.test(ee$x, ff$x) # reject null that two are equal

ee %>% bind_rows(ff) -> all_n_corrected # expanded counts combined into one data set. x is ages and z is otter.status
```

## Growth
** I have not run test or bootstraps to see if these two groups have statistically different growth.  This is just a visual comparison but note that sample size is larger in the present group.**

### VBL Length - Age
![](../figures/absent_VBL1.png)

```{r}
absent_raw %>% filter(!is.na (Valve.Length.mm)) -> absent_rawL # needed to remove rows without length measurements
#fit model setting t0=0 
vbTypical.t0 <- Valve.Length.mm~(Linf*(1-exp(-K*(Age_2012)))) # the equation to fit
fit2a <- nls(vbTypical.t0, data=absent_rawL, start= list(Linf=131, K=0.44))
summary(fit2a)

```


![](../figures/present_VBL1.png)

```{r}
present_raw %>% filter(!is.na (Valve.Length.mm)) -> present_rawL # needed to remove rows without length measurements
#fit model setting t0=0 
vbTypical.t0 <- Valve.Length.mm~(Linf*(1-exp(-K*(Age_2012)))) # the equation to fit
fit2 <- nls(vbTypical.t0, data=present_rawL, start= list(Linf=142, K=0.58))
summary(fit2)

```



### Weight - Length relationship
Using allometric growth model (Quinn and Deriso 1999)

#### Valve weight - length 
Group 1 - sea otter absent
Coefficients estimated from this relationship were A = 0.012 and B = 1.84.


![](../figures/absent_valveweight_length.png)


Group 2 - sea otter present
Coefficients estimated from this relationship were A = 0.00015 and B = 2.71.


![](../figures/present_valveweight_length.png)

#### Whole clam weight - length 
Group 1 - sea otter absent 
Coefficients estimated from this relationship were A = 0.066 and B = 1.97.

![](../figures/absent_wholeclamweight_length.png)


Group 2 - sea otter present
Coefficients estimated from this relationship were A = 0.00411 and B = 2.53.

### Weight - Age relationship

#### Valve Weight - Age relationship 
Group 1 - sea otter absent

![](../figures/absent_valveWlength.png)


```{r}
absent_rawL %>% filter(!is.na (WholeClamWeight_g)) -> absent_rawWL_whole
# input file for valve weight - removes blanks in these for analysis 
absent_rawL %>% filter(!is.na (Valve.Weight.g)) -> absent_rawWL_valve

#fit with t0=0, and B from W-L relationship B=1.84
vbTypical_WVB.a <- Valve.Weight.g~(Winf*(1-exp(-K*(Age_2012)))^1.84)
fit_WvalB.a <- nls(vbTypical_WVB.a, data=absent_rawWL_valve, start= list(Winf=150, K=0.05))
summary(fit_WvalB.a) ## need to save this for .RMD

```

Group 2 - sea otter present

![](../figures/present_valveWlength.png)


```{r}
present_rawL %>% filter(!is.na (WholeClamWeight_g)) -> present_rawWL_whole
# input file for valve weight - removes blanks in these for analysis 
present_rawL %>% filter(!is.na (Valve.Weight.g)) -> present_rawWL_valve

#fit with t0=0, and B from W-L relationship B=2.71
vbTypical_WVB <- Valve.Weight.g~(Winf*(1-exp(-K*(Age_2012)))^2.71)
fit_WvalB <- nls(vbTypical_WVB, data=present_rawWL_valve, start= list(Winf=150, K=0.05))
summary(fit_WvalB) ## need to save this for .RMD

```

## Catch Curve
### Traditional catch curve
Traditional catch curve methods were not useful for these groupings due to large numbers of high ages.  Traditional methods estimated Z to be 0.017 or less, which is unlikely.  These results did suggest a higher Z in sea otter present areas, but this appears mostly due to the peak age being alot higher at 63 (present group) versus the peak age of 50 (absent group).

I didn't get a chance to re-graph these (so they're not the best - they're the canned graphs from the fit output), but they use the weighted counts and display a catch curve for peak age to the age with the last observation greater than 1. 

![Catch curve using peak age to age with last observation greater than 1](../figures/traditional_catch_curve_weighted.png)


### Schnute 2007 method
The Schnute 2007 was preliminary examined for each group, preliminary results (which need to undergo sensitivity analyses) of average Z and the figure for the best model are presented below.  

**Group 1 - Absent**

Average Z (raw counts)= 0.045               
Average Z (weighted counts)= 0.038

![Best model (using AIC) for Group 1 sea otters absent](../figures/absent_attemp2_weighted.png)


**Group 2 - Present**

Average Z (raw counts)= 0.037               
Average Z (weighted counts)= 0.034

![Best model (using AIC) for Group 2 sea otters present](../figures/present_attemp2_weighted.png)


## Preliminary summary
It looks like there are some differences between these two groups, these are reflected in the age composition hisograms and kernal density plots.  However, preliminary results from the catch curve analysis are a bit confusing (not what would be expected if your hypothesis is that sea otter present area would have higher total mortality).  Further sensitivity analyses need to be performed on the catch curves, these data should not be shared or interpreted to seriously.
